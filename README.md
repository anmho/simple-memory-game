Submitted by: **Andrew Ho**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/courageous-charm-cornucopia?path=README.md%3A32%3A4)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.

- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

- [Learn JavaScript DOM Traversal In 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7rSSy8CaYE&t=529s)
- [Learn JavaScript Event Listeners In 18 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1_MlZ5l6M&t=251s)
- [Using the Range Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range)
- [Centering with CSS Grid](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-center-the-content-in-grid.html)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

- Coming up with a layout design was a bit challenging. To make it easier, I drew a mockup to try out different positions for various components (sliders, start button, attempts counter, timer). This was easier than trial and error of coding and saved me a lot of time.
- Button logic and game events were a bit tricky at first. To help me understand what would happen at any given state of the program, I drew a diagram modelling all the possible actions and outcomes before proceeding through the coding. 
- I found that drawing out a diagram and anticipating all the possible ways a user might interact with the program helped me visualize how the control flow would look like. Coming up with a design before beginning coding really helped the coding go smoothly by letting me focus on one action at a time and making sure that actions resulted in the intended behavior.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

    1) What are the pros and cons of different deployment methods (GitHub Pages, Heroku, Digital Ocean, Netlify)
    2) How does the web connect players of multiplayer games in real time? 
        - What are the different ways to make this project into a real time, online game and what are the pros and cons?
        - Instead of the sequence being randomly generated by the computer, one player might supply a difficult or unpredictable sequence each round,               while the other tries to remember the sequence.
    4) If this was a multiplayer game, how could I protect the game state from being tampered with?
        - I have heard that sockets can be used for this, but I would like to do some more research on what this really means and how it works.

4) How do web developers update their websites and apps while minimizing downtime? I'm curious as to how websites are able to be updated while seemingly being online 24/7 and relied upon by so many apps.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
- I would like to redo this project with React because there is a lot of state that would be far more easy to manage and organized. It would also be easier to break up the game into smaller pieces.
- Combining CSS modules with React would further help break the game up into multiple files, making it easier to refactor and understand.

2. A couple nice additional features I would add are
   a) Responsive interface so users can play the game on their phone (more intuitive to play game like this on their phone than on their laptop/desktop)
   a) Option to play for infinite rounds
   - This feature would coincide with the leaderboard
   b) Leaderboard
   - This would let users compete to see who could get the greatest streak.
   c) Colorblind mode
   d) Account system to track player progression on leaderboard.
   e) Unique sounds for each button
