# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Andrew Ho**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/courageous-charm-cornucopia?path=README.md%3A32%3A4)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

- [Learn JavaScript Event Listeners In 18 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1_MlZ5l6M&t=251s)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

- The main challenge I had when making the app was implementing button logic. I decided to try and implement this by myself before looking at the instructions. This program doesn’t really have an “end” like many programs which achieve certain tasks do and there aren’t multiple page destinations like on a website, which makes it easy to understand page responsibilities. Instead, there is a game-loop where any number of actions could be made on a single page.
- Since the user would be interacting with this app in real time, the control flow was different from the programs I usually write in class, since events would be spread out over time instead of done immediately in succession. I found that drawing out a diagram and anticipating all the possible ways a user might interact with the program helped me visualize how the control flow would look like. This let me focus on one action at a time and making sure that actions resulted in the intended behavior.
- After doing some research, I found out that this was called event driven programming, and I found this a good exercise in it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

1) How would I be able to deploy this app to people to use? Some ways I have found are GitHub Pages, Heroku, or Remote Server, What would be the pros and cons of each of these?
2) How is the web used to connect players of multiplayer games in real time? For example, I am curious on how I would transform this project into a real time, online game. Instead of the sequence being randomly generated by the computer, one player might supply a difficult or unpredictable sequence each round, while the other tries to remember the sequence.
3) After taking the CodePath cybersecurity course, I am interested as to how a leaderboard might implemented in a way that would be resistant to tampering?


    - I have heard that sockets can be used for this, but I would like to do some more research on what this really means and how it works.

4. How do web developers update their websites and apps while minimizing the time it might be down for? Something I’ve always found interesting is how websites are able to be updated while seemingly being online 24/7 and relied upon by so many apps.

4) If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

1. My first priority would be to refactor the code. I would focus on making it more organized so that adding features and making changes would be easier in the future.

- For example, I would like to split my button logic from my game logic into different modules to make it easier to understand. At the moment, the UI of my game and the application are fairly intertwined. An additional benefit this brings is making it easier to traverse the code and to iterate on game or control specific features.
- I would also like to make the button styles change color without needing to define a different style for every single button. This way, I could add any number of buttons I want to without having to change both my CSS and my HTML.
- One way I would achieve this is by using JavaScript to generate randomized colors, making sure the colors are different enough by a certain percentage from existing buttons. Then, I would create a new button and append a new button of that color whenever the user changed the number of buttons to play with.

2. A couple nice additional features I would add are
   a) Option to play for infinite rounds
   - This feature would coincide with the leaderboard
     b) Leaderboard
   - This would let users compete to see who could get the greatest streak.
     c) Colorblind mode
     d) Dark mode
     e) Account system to track player progression on leaderboard.
